The Planning
Task 1: You are to design the site you have decided to build. The design consists of FOUR PHASES; each phase MUST be complete before you continue to Task 2. (P4)

Inspiration Board your ideas. Collate colours, styles, layouts, fonts anything that gives you inspiration for your website. Consider tools such as:
Tools - Pinterest, StumbleUpon and Adobe Kuler.
Site Navigation. Mock up a tree diagram of your site navigation.
Wireframe your site. There are two sides to this, the basic layout and a mock-up. Good software to use:
Basic layout â€“ Google Slide / Moqups.com
Detailed mock-up - Photoshop or at least more detail using whatever software you wish.
